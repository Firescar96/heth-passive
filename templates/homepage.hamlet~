<h1>FlexExp - the flexible Blockchain Explorer brought to you by BlockApps.net

<p>
  Most Blockchain explorers are limited to queries involving single block, transaction or account state lookups.
  Ours will allow some more flexible queries than you are used to. See for yourself!

  Sending us a post a /pquery/ should yield some incomprehensible html, with a reference to a Block!

  Example:


  After it's running, try
  curl -d "{\"tag\":\"BlkQuery\",\"contents\":{\"tag\":\"ByNumber\",\"number\":17}}" http://localhost:3000/pquery
